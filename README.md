# Pi-Pico-Firmware (ALPHA TESTING)
Pi Pico Firmware (or PPF for short) is a firmware like program that makes it easier to use and code the Raspberry Pi Pico. The Pi Pico or the Raspberry Pi Pico is a microcontroller that is popular yes, but many people dont code it because its finicky and there isn't that much documentation. Well this *Partially* solves that with many amenities that make coding the Raspberry Pi Pico *better*.

## Its uses include:
- Boot Screens
- Error Screens (Not yet done)
- Logs (Partially done)
- Autosaving Code (Not yet done)

## Prerequisites
- 16x2 LCD (Optional)
- Raspberry Pi Pico (W/WH Support not included, Use at your own risk)
- Breadboard or Electronics (Optional)
- Thonny or a Code Editor

## How To Use
1. Download the files
2. Plug your Raspberry Pi PIco in
3. Open code.py
4. Put your code in the "Main" Class

## Notes
- Other RP2040 devices might not work.
- Most (If not all) non RP2040 MicroPython Devices will not work and might even damage the device
- The recommended device for this program is The "Raspberry Pi Pico Normal/H"

## Updates Coming Soon
(This List is ordered by priority, top meaning most priority and bottom meaning least priority)
- Logs
- Error Screens
- Autosaving Code
- Raspberry Pi Pico W/WH Support
